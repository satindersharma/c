std => standard library

cout => charactor out, we can output one or more charactor

variables

varibale is a name of lacation of a memmory

declare int a;

if not initialized, due to garbage, data currently in memory



int filze_size = 0, counter = 1;
also this works, but not ecouraged

const double pi = 3.14;
act like js const




int file_size // Snake Case

int FileSIze // pascal case

int fileSize // camel Case

int iFileSize // hugarian case (just like pascal case but the data type is in the front) it is very old , not releven but is in the old window code, that time the ede+itor was ot that feature rich





using namespace std;

now you can use cout instead of std::cout

endl  to make a new line charactor
